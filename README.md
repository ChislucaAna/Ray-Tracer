All the parameters for the ray tracing can be modified in the form.cs. This includes number of rays and blocks, size range for blocks and the size for the source of light.
To select the form you want to run you can modify the program cs file at line 14 by replacing the current form name with the one you wish to run.
While running, click on current form in order to generate random map of rays.
